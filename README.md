# UVic-Protoplanet-research
Research conducted at the University of Victoria with Dr. Doug Johnstone, Dr. Logan Francis and Dr. Nienke Van der Marel, working on protoplanet data. This fitting model was used to create a guassian profile 
for a emission profile, later it was superimposed on the data using DS9 to confirm the fit was accurate.
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo data fitting methods were used
