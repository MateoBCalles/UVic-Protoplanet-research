# UVic-Protoplanet-research
Research conducted at UVic with Dough Johnstone working on protoplanet data. This fitting model was used to create a guassian profile 
for a emission profile, later it was superimposed on the data using DS9 to confirm the fit was accurate.
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo dating fitting methods were used
